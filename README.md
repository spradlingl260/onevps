## ONEVPS Review
ONEVPS offers competitive VPS solutions with extensive geographic coverage and robust technical specifications at affordable prices. Noteworthy is their non-direct connection routes in Asia, particularly in Japan and Singapore, which are not directly connected to China. This may affect customers requiring high bandwidth international routes within Asia. Additionally, while the base prices are competitive, certain nodes might require an additional fee.

Payment methods supported by ONEVPS include PayPal and Alipay, making it convenient for international customers to transact securely.
